# Dojo Breaker

A simple Arkanoid clone built in Unity 5 on the codebase from [The Complete Unity Developer](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/?couponCode=GitHubDiscount) course.

Intended for CoderDojo ninjas to see their way around Unity, see for themselves the ease of writing for the FiftySix Android tablet, and modify themselves including adding new levels.
